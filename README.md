This project includes neural-network for image recognition. It's trained on CIFAR-10 dataset. This dataset includes 10 classes of objects each with 6k images. 

The network is trained on 50k images and is evaluated on 10k images. 

You can use this network to recognize image if it is from one of these classes = ["airplane", "automobile", "bird", "cat", "deer", "dog", "frog", "horse", "ship", "truck"]

Than the neural network should give you appropriate index of class and name of class to which your image belongs.
